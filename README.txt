This is a quick release of 1.5. I didn't even expect to release it, however, their may be bugs.
If you do encounter them, quickly report them to me so I can release a patched version, thanks.
^^^^^
tl;dr - is "early release" version, so report bugs.

tl;dr - allowed to remove RCS footer. Don't provide direct download links to RCS.

Upon installation, an account with the username Report is created. Do not
modify or delete this account. It is the account that is used which will
automatically post forum reports in the specified report section. In
no way can the account allow someone to gain administrative access to your
site. Upon every RCS installation, the account is given a randomly generated
cookie/session (so it's not the same cookie for everyone), and even if 
someone managed to get the password to the account, login is disabled for it. 

^^^^^
tl;dr - don't delete/modify the administrative user Report. It's safe & necessary.
