# RCS [RuneScape Community Script]
An entire community management system, written entirely by myself starting in 2011. The last published version of this software was in 2012.

Background history of this project: A community of people played the online game RuneScape. For nostalgic reasons, they hired me to recreate the old website as it was in the year 2007.

This includes recreating a user account system, fully functional forum system, account messaging center, content management system, moderation tools for moderators and administrators to manage the community and forums, and a lot more.

Eventually due to the popularity of this software, I released it to the public for people to use as their website.

**NOTE: All the PHP & SQL code is 100% mine; however, because this was a recreation of an old website, the images and website CSS and majority of the HTML code do not belong to me, as they were recovered from an existing template.**
